## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- RapidAPI account with Try-On Diffusion API access

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-try-on-app.git
   cd virtual-try-on-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   export RAPIDAPI_KEY="your-rapidapi-key-here"
   ```
   
   Or create a `.env` file:
   ```
   RAPIDAPI_KEY=your-rapidapi-key-here
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser** and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:7860`)

## üîß Configuration

### API Setup

1. Sign up for [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)
2. Subscribe to the [Try-On Diffusion API](https://rapidapi.com/try-on-diffusion/api/try-on-diffusion)
3. Get your API key from the RapidAPI dashboard
4. Set the `RAPIDAPI_KEY` environment variable

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `RAPIDAPI_KEY` | Your RapidAPI key for Try-On Diffusion API | Yes |

## üìã Usage

1. **Upload Your Photo**: Use a clear, well-lit photo where you're facing forward
2. **Upload Clothing Item**: Upload an image of the clothing item you want to try on
3. **Enter Measurements** (Optional): Provide your measurements for better fit analysis
   - Height (cm)
   - Chest (cm)
   - Waist (cm)
   - Sleeve length (cm)
4. **Click "Try On Outfit"**: Wait for the AI to process your request
5. **View Results**: See the try-on result and fit advice

### Tips for Best Results

- Use high-quality, well-lit images
- Ensure the person is facing forward in the photo
- Use clothing images with clear, unobstructed views
- Avoid images with complex backgrounds
- Make sure images are not too large (recommended: under 2MB)

## üîß Technical Details

### Core Components

- **Gradio Interface**: Provides the web UI for user interactions
- **OpenCV**: Handles image processing and format conversions
- **Try-On Diffusion API**: Performs the actual AI-powered try-on generation
- **PIL/Pillow**: Additional image processing capabilities

### API Integration

The app integrates with the Try-On Diffusion API through a custom client that handles:
- Image format conversions (RGB ‚Üî BGR)
- Multipart form data encoding
- Error handling and response processing
- RapidAPI authentication

## üöÄ Deployment

### Hugging Face Spaces

1. Create a new Space on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces)
2. Choose Gradio as the SDK
3. Upload all project files
4. Set `RAPIDAPI_KEY` as a repository secret
5. The app will automatically build and deploy


### Local Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run with auto-reload
python app.py --reload
```




## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors on Hugging Face Spaces**
- Ensure `requirements.txt` only contains valid PyPI packages
- Check that all files are properly uploaded

**API Errors**
- Verify your RapidAPI key is correct and active
- Check your API usage limits
- Ensure images are in supported formats

**Poor Results**
- Use high-quality, well-lit images
- Ensure the person is facing forward
- Try different clothing items or poses
